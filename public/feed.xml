			<title>Uxn Zine</title>
			<pubDate>Wed, 01 Feb 2023 09:45:16 +0900</pubDate>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[ <p><a href="https://merveilles.town/@rostiger">Rostiger</a> made an awesome comic explaining how <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/uxn.html">Uxn</a> works, so I compiled the drawings into a pdf designed to be printed and made into a zine. It turned out pretty well, and the template is simple enough to be reused. You can download the <a href="files/uxn-zine/uxn-zine.pdf">pdf</a> or <a href="files/uxn-zine/uxn-zine.pdf">epub</a> directly, or download a <a href="files/uxn-zine.tar">tar</a> of all of files and resources to compile it yourself. Assembly is mostly as describer in <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Zine_Making/Putting_pages_together#An_8-sided_zine_from_1_sheet_with_1_cut">this article</a>, but once folded according to the directions, staple the spine together and cut the tops and bottoms of the few pages still connected. It's a little jank, but it works!</p> ]]>

			<title>Intro to WFC</title>
			<pubDate>Sun, 29 Jan 2023 11:37:25 +0900</pubDate>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[ <p>First developed in October 2016 by <a href="https://twitter.com/ExUtumno/">Maxim Gumin</a> (based on an earlier 2009 algorithm called <a href="https://paulmerrell.org/model-synthesis/">Model Synthesis</a> by <a href="https://paulmerrell.org/">Paul Merrell</a>), the <a href="https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse">wfc algorithm</a> is a method of generating novel textures from a given input texture. The main reason this algorithm is interesting is that the output is locally similar to the input, as defined in the repository:</p> ]]>

			<title>WFC Propagator Constructor</title>
			<pubDate>Sun, 29 Jan 2023 11:35:43 +0900</pubDate>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[ <p> The propagator (and the constructor system) is probably the most often misunderstood part of the wfc algorithm. The basic idea is that it's a way to easily access the adjacency data generated in the tile generation stage. The propagator constructor generates four lists of booleans (one list for each side of the tile) for every tile, where each boolean corresponds to whether or not a tile can go in the adjacent location which the list is describing. Now that's a lot of words, so let's see how it looks.</p> ]]>

			<title>Overview of WFC Algorithm</title>
			<pubDate>Sun, 29 Jan 2023 11:31:22 +0900</pubDate>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[ <p>My wfc implementation is made of four main systems. Mine are called the tile generator, the propagator constructor, the observer, and the propagator, and though other people may call them different things they make up the basis of how wfc works. They all act on or help to create the main data structure of wfc, the wave. The wave keeps track of which tiles can go in which spaces, and to begin with it starts as a totally "un collapsed" wave, which means that every tile is allowed everywhere. Over the course of the algorithm's running, the four main systems will "collapse" the wave into a definite image.</p> ]]>

I should have "--help" menus for some of these, but don't hesitate to ask me a question if something still doesn't make sense.</p> ]]>

			<description>
				<![CDATA[ <p>The wave function collapse algorithm is a novel way of generating textures (and sometimes even 3d models) from a very small input sample, making it interesting for aritists, indie game devs, and programmers who want to spend a lot of time (in <a href="https://github.com/flber/WFC">my case</a> like 3 years lol) writing a fun proc gen algorithm which you then don't really have to think about once it's done.</p> ]]>

			<description>
				<![CDATA[ <p>Her footsteps echoed off the marble floor, its surface perfectly reflecting the inky shadows far above. The journey up the mountain range which was all that was left of the Colossus’ spine had taken days of walking between ribs and broken bones of metal which leaned precariously, like poorly constructed skyscrapers. Thin beams of red light from the sinking star outside streamed down at a shallow angle through the orbital fissures, illuminating the dunes of old paper within. An entire world’s knowledge had been sacrificed here, offered to a being created with the hope that it could solve their problems. The craters and deserts which still marred the planet’s surface all these millenia later were testaments to their failure; even a giant with the power to move mountains and the knowledge to answer any question could not change their nature. </p> ]]>

				<![CDATA[ <p>Pillar is my custom static site generator, used to build this <a href="site.html">site</a>. While my site is probably still small enough that I could build it by hand, writing my own site generator (with a custom-ish markup language) was and is a lot of fun :></p> ]]>

			<title>Plan 9</title>
			<pubDate>Tue, 22 Nov 2022 11:50:07 +0900</pubDate>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[ <p>I first encountered Plan 9 on Devine Lu Linvega's site and was immediately interested in its minimalist design and "more unix than unix" philosophy. If you've never heard of it before, Plan 9 is a research operating system developed by Bell Labs in 1992, and takes the unix principle of everything as a file to the extreme. It has a lot of other interesting features and quirks, and if you're interested in learning more about them I would highly recommend the the Plan 9 <a href="https://9p.io/plan9/about.html">about page</a> or the <a href="https://9p.io/sys/doc/">several papers</a> written about the operating system.</p> ]]>

			<description>
				<![CDATA[ <p>I've always found liminal spaces, those odd facets that don't quite seem to match the rest of reality, oddly beautiful. I'm not sure what about them I've feel drawn to, but they're just something which I find fascinating. Here are some great examples, created by the talented <a href="https://carlburton.io">Carl Burton</a>.</p> ]]>

			<title>ffstream tools</title>

			<description>
				<![CDATA[ <p><a href="https://github.com/flber/ffstream">ffstream</a> is really a loose collection of scripts and miscellaneous files, and is my setup for streaming (to twitch.tv in my case) using ffmpeg! At the moment the main section is stuff which "just works" (lol not really) and an <code>extra/</code> directory for experimental ffmpeg ramblings. The long-term goal is to turn it into a compiled, cross-platform application which is <em>actually useful</em>, but the short-term goal is to actually have something working :)</p> ]]>

			<title>Intro to Dwarf Fortress</title>

				<![CDATA[ <p>I seriously love dwarf fortress; it's a game with such absurd complexity that I've kept coming back to it for years, through tons of updates and changes. Of course, if you're here, you've probably already decided to try it out, so I'll spare you too many of my appreciative ramblings on it's scope and gameplay :)</p> ]]>

			<description>
				<![CDATA[ <p>Wooo! It's October! Other than being one of my favorite months, I'm excited for October this year because I'm participating in a game jam called <a href="https://itch.io/jam/devtober-2019">Devtober</a>. It's a challenge to work on a game a bit every day for the month of October, and if you want to learn more (or participate in it) I'd recommend checking out their page. Other responsibilities kicked my butt today, so I'm just going to write this overview of the idea and maybe a toot.</p> ]]>

				<![CDATA[ <p>I really enjoy rock climbing, mostly bouldering, but my school doesn't have any official on-campus climbing walls and the nearest gym is a half-hour bus ride away. What I've done recently is found some buildings which have rough sandstone brick walls to climb late at night.</p> ]]>

			<title>Leaving the Digital Nest</title>
			<pubDate>Tue, 22 Nov 2022 11:50:07 +0900</pubDate>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[ <p>I am not an old person. In fact, I am quite a young person. I think (though I have little evidence to back this up, other than a vague feeling of unease) that I am one of the last generations to be born without an iphone in hand. That is certainly not to say that my childhood was without the presence of mobile technology, it absolutely had an impact on me, I just think it arrived fully in my life late enough to miss some crucial period of development.</p> ]]>

			<title>Casio CA53W</title>
			<pubDate>Tue, 22 Nov 2022 11:50:07 +0900</pubDate>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[ <p>I love the <a href="https://www.casio.com/products/watches/databank/ca53w-1">Casio CA53W</a>; it's small, cheap, and has all the features I need (24-hour time, stopwatch, alarm, waterproof) as well as some features I just like (it's a calculator!). A while ago I inverted the display so it was white-on-black, and while it looked really cool, it was almost totally illegible except in direct light. I eventually just reverted the change, and recorded the process because I hadn't seen any good explanations of how to do it. To be honest it's not that complicated, but hopefully this super low-res video could help with some specifics of the process. I'll also add a written description of what I'm doing with timestamps, but considering the video is half an hour long, it might take a while :)</p> ]]>
