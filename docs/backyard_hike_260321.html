<h2>Backyard Hike 260321</h2>

<p>After being stuck inside for a while, I decided to do some off-trail hiking near my house. I found some turkeys, a bone, and lots of nature.</p>

<img src="images/backyard_hike/turkeys.gif" alt="some turkeys hiding in the underbrush"></img>
<p>Though you can barely see it in this photo, there was in fact a large group of turkeys.  they did eventually wander away from me, but they seemed remarkably calm of me invading their space. I did try to move as quietly as possible.</p>

<img src="images/backyard_hike/bone.gif" alt="a grayish and uncomfortably large bone sitting on some oak leaves"></img>
<p>I found this bone near where I saw those turkeys, and though it is almost certainly a deer bone, it's still a little disconcerting.</p>

<img src="images/backyard_hike/undergrowth.gif" alt="a hill covered in thick underbrush"></img>
<p>This was a view back up the hill I had climbed down. The underbrush shown here is pretty thick, that's for most of the hike I managed to stay on relatively clear deer trails. </p>

<img src="images/backyard_hike/prickleberry.gif" alt="this plant may or may not be a prickleberry"></img>
<p>An uninvitingly thorny plant which may be a prickleberry bush. I did not eat any of it to find out. </p>

<img src="images/backyard_hike/mossy_rock.gif" alt="a mossy rock"></img>
<p>Just a mossy rock. </p>

<img src="images/backyard_hike/stick_pile.gif" alt="a curious pile of sticks"></img>
<p>I'm really not sure what made this pile of sticks, as I was deep into some underbrush, and I doubt anyone else would have gone there to assemble it. It could have been the remnants of a tree, but I didn't actually see any tall trees nearby. This is still a mystery </p>

<img src="images/backyard_hike/nest.gif" alt="possible a bird nest, maybe of some kind of raptor"></img>
<p>Another pile of sticks, but I found this one on top of the underbrush, so it is likely some form of bird nest. It might be a raptor's nest, but I'm not sure. </p>

<img src="images/backyard_hike/last_stretch.gif" alt="my outstretched hand reaching for an opening in thick underbrush"></img>
<p>The last stretch of underbrush I had to get through was especially dense, and though I was certainly being a bit over dramatic in this photo, I was actually crawling to get through by this point</p>

<img src="images/backyard_hike/hill.gif" alt="a view of the hill I hiked down"></img>
<p>A view back on the hill I hiked down. It seemed like a lot longer when I was in it...</p>
