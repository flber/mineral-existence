## Abilities
**Magical Tinkering**
*Touch a Tiny nonmagical object as an action and give it one of the following magical properties of your choice.*
- The object sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.
- Whenever tapped by a creature, the object emits a recorded message that can be heard up to 10 feet away. You utter the message when you bestow this property on the object, and the recording can be no more than 6 seconds long.
- The object continuously emits your choice of an odor or a nonverbal sound (wind, waves, chirping, or the like). The chosen phenomenon is perceivable up to 10 feet away.
- A static visual effect appears on one of the objectâ€™s surfaces. This effect can be a picture, up to 25 words of text, lines and shapes, or a mixture of these elements, as you like.

**Infuse Item**
*Imbue mundane items with certain magical infusions; the magic items you create with this feature are effectively prototypes of permanent items; finish a long rest, you can touch a nonmagical object and imbue it with one of your artificer infusions.*
- *Enhanced Defense*: Item: A suit of armor or a shield; A creature gains a +1 bonus to Armor Class while wearing (armor) or wielding (shield) the infused item.
- *Enhanced Weapon*: Item: A simple or martial weapon; This magic weapon grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.
- *Repeating Shot*: Item: A simple or martial weapon with the ammunition property (requires attunement); This magic weapon grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it when it's used to make a ranged attack, and it ignores the loading property if it has it (makes its own ammo)
- *Homunculus Servant*: Item: A gem worth at least 100 gp or a dragonshard; magically creating a special homunculus that serves you. The item you infuse serves as the creature's heart, around which the creature's body instantly forms; you determine the homunculus's appearance;

**Right Tool for the Job**
*with tinker's tools in hand, you can magically create one set of artisan's tools in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. This creation requires 1 hour of uninterrupted work, which can coincide with a short or long rest*
