		<p>I'm Ben (they/them), a second year college student working on various software projects. You can view my Github profile <a href="https://github.com/flber">here</a>, which shows most of my work over the past five or so years. I also have a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-hammond-855ba5191/">LinkedIn</a>. My <a href="../home.html">website</a> is a blog and personal wiki which I update with some regularity. On it, you can learn more about the <a href="https://github.com/flber/Pillar">tools</a> I built to write it and learn more <a href="../about.html">about me</a>.</p>

			<span><a href="https://rarebase.org"><b>Rarebase</b></a> <i>Engineering Internship</i></span> <span>2 months</span>
		</div>
		<p>At Rarebase I built real-time data visualization apps used both internally and externally, deployed with Google Cloud Computing services such as Cloud Run and Workflows.</p>
		<p><b>Recommendation:</b> "Ben proved to be a versatile, self-directed engineer. They built data visualization web apps, including the data pipelines feeding them, to view aggregate statistics of biological datasets, helping improve our operational insight. This required assessing and using a number of technologies that were not yet currently at use in Rarebase" - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/clayton-mellina?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base%3BR%2BSqLv43RyGyFkJpNz2tFA%3D%3D">Clayton Mellina</a></p>
