		<p>I'm Ben, a college sophomore working on various software projects. You can view my Github profile <a href="https://github.com/flber">here</a>, which shows most of my work over the past five or so years. The <a href="../home.html">rest</a> of this site is a blog and personal wiki which I update with some regularity. You can learn more about the tools I built to write it <a href="https://github.com/flber/Pillar">here</a>, and learn more about me <a href="../about.html">here</a>.</p>

		<h2>Work Experience</h2>

		</div>
		<p>At Rarebase I built real-time data visualization apps for both internal and external use using Google Cloud Computing services. Over the two months I was there, I built a data processing and visualization pipeline for displaying a summary of our in-house lab data, which was displayed as a webpage running through a Cloud Function. I also implemented internal tooling for rendering cell platemap data using Dash and Cloud Run, which was used by Rarebase's bioinformaticists to streamline their data processing workflow.</p>

I also have experience with Windows 10, Mac, and linux (Arch, Debian, and Ubuntu).</p>
