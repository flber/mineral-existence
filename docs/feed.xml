				<![CDATA[ <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/flbr/Pillar">Pillar</a> is my custom static site generator, used to build this <a href="site.html">site</a>. While my site is probably still small enough that I could build it by hand, writing my own site generator (with a custom-ish markup language) was and is a lot of fun :></p> ]]>

I like to make <a href="recipes.html">food</a>, occasionally <a href="drawings.html">draw</a>, and tell computers to do things for me (though we often have disagreements). I've worked on a few <a href="projects.html">projects</a>, including a <a href="https://flber.itch.io/">game or two</a>. When I'm not getting frustrated with computers for not following my every command, I enjoy playing <a href="games.html">video games</a>, <a href="hiking.html">hiking</a>, <a href="reading.html">reading</a>, and thinking about designs for watch movements (though I still have yet to build one).</p> ]]>

			<title>Casio CA53W</title>
			<pubDate>Mon, 04 Apr 2022 18:31:05 +0900</pubDate>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[ <p>I love the <a href="https://www.casio.com/products/watches/databank/ca53w-1">Casio CA53W</a>; it's small, cheap, and has all the features I need (24-hour time, stopwatch, alarm, waterproof) as well as some features I just like (it's a calculator!). A while ago I inverted the display so it was white-on-black, and while it looked really cool, it was almost totally illegible except in direct light. I eventually just reverted the change, and recorded the process because I hadn't seen any good explanations of how to do it. To be honest it's not that complicated, but hopefully this super low-res video could help with some specifics of the process. I'll also add a written description of what I'm doing with timestamps, but considering the video is half an hour long, it might take a while :)</p> ]]>

			<title>My Notes on WFC</title>
			<pubDate>Mon, 21 Mar 2022 10:06:22 +0900</pubDate>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[ <p>The wave function collapse algorithm is a novel way of generating textures (and sometimes even 3d models) from a very small input sample, making it interesting for aritists, indie game devs, and programmers who want to spend a lot of time (in <a href="https://github.com/flber/WFC">my case</a> like 3 years lol) writing a fun proc gen algorithm which you then don't really have to think about once it's done.</p> ]]>

			<title>WFC Tile Generator</title>

			<title>WFC Propagator Constructor</title>
			<pubDate>Mon, 07 Mar 2022 13:44:27 +0900</pubDate>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[ <p> The propagator (and the constructor system) is probably the most often misunderstood part of the wfc algorithm. The basic idea is that it's a way to easily access the adjacency data generated in the tile generation stage. The propagator constructor generates four lists of booleans (one list for each side of the tile) for every tile, where each boolean corresponds to whether or not a tile can go in the adjacent location which the list is describing. Now that's a lot of words, so let's see how it looks.</p> ]]>

I should have "--help" menus for most of these, but don't hesitate to ask me a question if something still doesn't make sense.</p> ]]>

			<title>The Sands of Time</title>
			<pubDate>Mon, 07 Mar 2022 13:44:27 +0900</pubDate>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[ <p>Her footsteps echoed off the marble floor, its surface perfectly reflecting the inky shadows far above. The journey up the mountain range which was all that was left of the Colossus’ spine had taken days of walking between ribs and broken bones of metal which leaned precariously, like poorly constructed skyscrapers. Thin beams of red light from the sinking star outside streamed down at a shallow angle through the orbital fissures, illuminating the dunes of old paper within. An entire world’s knowledge had been sacrificed here, offered to a being created with the hope that it could solve their problems. The craters and deserts which still marred the planet’s surface all these millenia later were testaments to their failure; even a giant with the power to move mountains and the knowledge to answer any question could not change their nature. </p> ]]>

			<title>Plan 9</title>

			<description>
				<![CDATA[ <p>I first encountered Plan 9 on Devine Lu Linvega's site and was immediately interested in its minimalist design and "more unix than unix" philosophy. If you've never heard of it before, Plan 9 is a research operating system developed by Bell Labs in 1992, and takes the unix principle of everything as a file to the extreme. It has a lot of other interesting features and quirks, and if you're interested in learning more about them I would highly recommend the the Plan 9 <a href="https://9p.io/plan9/about.html">about page</a> or the <a href="https://9p.io/sys/doc/">several papers</a> written about the operating system.</p> ]]>

			<title>Overview of WFC</title>
			<pubDate>Mon, 07 Mar 2022 13:44:27 +0900</pubDate>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[ <p>My wfc implementation is made of four main systems. Mine are called the tile generator, the propagator constructor, the observer, and the propagator, and though other people may call them different things they make up the basis of how wfc works. They all act on or help to create the main data structure of wfc, the wave. The wave keeps track of which tiles can go in which spaces, and to begin with it starts as a totally "un collapsed" wave, which means that every tile is allowed everywhere. Over the course of the algorithm's running, the four main systems will "collapse" the wave into a definite image.</p> ]]>

				<![CDATA[ <p>First of all, this is going to primarily be a place to store notes for myself as I learn Rust, so take everything I say with a grain of salt! (and feedback is always appreciated, so feel free to say hi)</p> ]]>

			<title>Leaving the Digital Nest</title>
			<pubDate>Mon, 07 Mar 2022 13:44:26 +0900</pubDate>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[ <p>I am not an old person. In fact, I am quite a young person. I think (though I have little evidence to back this up, other than a vague feeling of unease) that I am one of the last generations to be born without an iphone in hand. That is certainly not to say that my childhood was without the presence of mobile technology, it absolutely had an impact on me, I just think it arrived fully in my life late enough to miss some crucial period of development.</p> ]]>

			<title>Devtober</title>

			<description>
				<![CDATA[ <p>Wooo! It's October! Other than being one of my favorite months, I'm excited for October this year because I'm participating in a game jam called <a href="https://itch.io/jam/devtober-2019">Devtober</a>. It's a challenge to work on a game a bit every day for the month of October, and if you want to learn more (or participate in it) I'd recommend checking out their page. Other responsibilities kicked my butt today, so I'm just going to write this overview of the idea and maybe a toot.</p> ]]>
