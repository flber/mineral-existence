[h2|Nice to meet you!]

[p|I'm Ben, a person (who prefers they/them pronouns) from the bay area, though I go to school in Santa Cruz. I like to make [a, href: "recipes.html"|food], occasionally [a, href: "drawings.html"|draw], and tell computers to do things for me (though we often have disagreements).]

[p|I've worked on a few [a, href: "projects.html"|projects], including a [a, href: "https://flber.itch.io/"|game or two]. When I'm not getting frustrated with computers for disagreeing with what I want them to do, I enjoy [a, href: "hiking.html"|hiking], playing [a, href: "games.html"|video games], and [a, href: "reading.html"|reading].]

[p|If you like, you can [button, id: "hello_button", onclick: "usercount()"|say hi] to me directly! So far, [code id: "count"|0?] people have said hi :&gt;]
[details|
	[summary|How does it work?]
	[p|Using my Fancy New Frameworkâ„¢ (26 lines of vanilla js), when you press the button it sends a request to an api endpoint on the [a, href: "https://rocket.rs"|rocket] server hosting this site. That fetch is sent back a simple JSON object containing the total number of visitors so far, and that number is put into the code tag! Then after you've pressed it, the button is changed to "<del>say hi</del>" to indicate that you can't press it again. For the moment you can reload the page and that change will revert, though the server still will only [i|register] one press per ip.]
	[p|On the backend, the request headers are unpacked to get the visitor's ip address, which, if new, is added to a list of "known" addresses, and the total count is incremented by one and returned. If the ip address in the request [i|is] a known address, the count is not increased but is still returned.]

[script|
	function usercount() {
		fetch("/api/count", {
			method: "POST"}).then(async (res) => {
				const raw = await res.text();
				console.log(raw);
			})
		get_usercount()

		var button = document.getElementById("hello_button");
		var b = document.createElement("del");
		var new_text = document.createTextNode("say hi");
		b.appendChild(new_text);
		button.replaceWith(b);
	}

	window.onload = function() {
		get_usercount()
	}

	function get_usercount() {
		fetch("/api/count", {
			method: "GET",
			headers: {
			'Accept': 'application/json',
			'Content-Type': 'application/json',
			}}).then(async (res) => {
			const raw = await res.text();
			const parsed = raw ? JSON.parse(raw) : { success: res.ok };

			var num = document.getElementById("count");
			num.innerHTML = parsed['user_count'];
		})
	}
