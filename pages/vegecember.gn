[p|For this December I'm only making vegetarian meals, and I'll keep pictures of one meal from each day here! There's probably going to be a lot of rice and tofu :Ãž]

	[p|I ran out of the homemade kimchi from Oakland, so this is just whatever Safeway had on hand. It was still okay, but has so much less flavour.]

	[p|I found my new favorite cafe in Santa Cruz, [a, href: "https://mariposacoffeebar.com"|Mariposa Coffee Bar]! They make amazing cafecitos - which I learned is espresso and whipped brown sugar - and these vegetarian cubanos, which are also delicious.]
