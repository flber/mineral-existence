[p|This is a loose collection of notes, links, and other resources. See my [a, href: "grimoire.html"|grimoire] for snippets which I find useful (if perhaps a bit haunted)]

[p|While I do find this useful, I think I'll be moving most of this information to a "bookmarks" page, and change this to a centralized list of my own pages.]
